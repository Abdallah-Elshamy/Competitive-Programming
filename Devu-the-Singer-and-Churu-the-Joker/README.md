The Comedian, Churu will crack jokes. All his jokes are of 5 minutes exactly.

People have mainly come to listen Devu. But you know that he needs rest of 10 minutes after each song. On the other hand, Churu being a very active person, doesn't need any rest.

You as one of the organizers should make an optimal sсhedule for the event. For some reasons you must follow the conditions:

    Devu must complete all his songs;
    With satisfying the two previous conditions the number of jokes cracked by Churu should be as many as possible.
