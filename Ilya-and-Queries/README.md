# Ilya-and-Queries
A solution for Ilya and Queries problem in codeforces   http://codeforces.com/contest/313/problem/B

Ilya the Lion wants to help all his friends with passing exams. They need to solve the following problem to pass the IT exam.

You've got string s = s1s2... sn (n is the length of the string), consisting only of characters "." and "#" and m queries. Each query is described by a pair of integers li, ri (1 ≤ li < ri ≤ n). The answer to the query li, ri is the number of such integers i (li ≤ i < ri), that si = si + 1.

Ilya the Lion wants to help his friends but is there anyone to help him? Help Ilya, solve the problem.

Input

The first line contains string s of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105). It is guaranteed that the given string only consists of characters "." and "#".

The next line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the number of queries. Each of the next m lines contains the description of the corresponding query. The i-th line contains integers li, ri (1 ≤ li < ri ≤ n).

Output

Print m integers — the answers to the queries in the order in which they are given in the input.
